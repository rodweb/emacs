* Basic

** TODO Add this to GitHub

* Bookmarking

** TODO Annotate important places in the code, without polluting bookmark list

** TODO Show bookmarks on =projectile-find-file=

* Code navigation

** TODO Ignore the first result when consulting references with =xref=

The first result is the symbol I'm currently searching from. I
don't need it to show up.

** TODO Show a completing read list for recent edit locations =g;=

* Debugging

** TODO Debug existing test =golang=

* Git

** TODO Add option to copy =github= URL from default branch

Currently, a =permalink= is generated. I'd like a basic URL to =github=
in the default branch

** TODO Open file in GitHub web app

* Golang

** TODO Install a Golang dependency ~go get~

* Spell checking and dictionary

** TODO Create function to word at-point to personal dictionary

** TODO Make sure personal dictionary is tracked in Git

* Search and replace

** TODO Add UI hint when =word= search is enabled

** TODO Allow searching ignoring just some patterns (e.g. =.git= directories)

I want to search across a mono repository that ignores cloned stuff.
I want to ignore noisy stuff but still be able to search across
projects from different repositories in the same root directory.

** DONE Fix searching for =non= test files (including =*_test.go=)

** TODO Find a way to filter results incrementally

Let's say I start with the search term =Message=, then I see lots of
results for =MessageDeprected=. I want to ignore matches for =MessageDeprecated=.

** TODO Remove matches from search results

Sometimes I want to manually remove some results from the search

** TODO Automatically save =rg= results based on the query

** DONE Add an easy way to filter by file type (e.g.: =\*.proto=)

Just type =f= to select the file type

** TODO Find a way to avoid having to escape =*= (e.g.: =\*.proto=)

* Testing

** TODO Toggle between test and implementation in Golang

* Brainstorm

** Context management

If I'm working in a work project during the day, I'd like to have a
separate context for working in personal projects at night.

Requirements:
- Separate buffer list per context
- Restore session for multiple contexts
